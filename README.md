Console Java program to calculate parameters of line with the least-squares approximation

For the purpose of this task, I used the algorithm contained in the website:

You can run a Java program in two ways:

1. Without passing arguments, the program executes the following scenario:
  - asks for the number of random points to generate;
  - draw N random points and save them to a file; 
  - designates and writes in the console the y = ax + b straight line.
 
2. Given the first argument of the filename containing the point data as follows:
X_point_point [space] Point_value [fron0]
Fractional part of the number must be entered after the period.
Example:
5.86 5.57
2.36 3.76
0.88 7.18
9.64 4.73
 
Startup will cause the y = ax + b line to be written to the console.
 
* The data file must be placed next to the src directory.
